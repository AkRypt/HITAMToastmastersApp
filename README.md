# HITAM Toastmasters App
Seeing the usage of so much of paper to record timings of a speaker, to count the Ah's and Uh's and to record the grammar mistakes,  the members of Hitam TM didn't quite feel good about it.
Hence, we have decided to make an app which does all the paperwork such as recording the timings, recording the minutes of meetings, etc,. 
Additionally, the app also consists of the details of all the members and their activities which facilitates the process of identifying good and actively participating speakers.

By using the app, members can check what all meetings the other members have attended and what they have achieved which gives a sense of competence which in turn gives all the members some motivation to do a lot better.

Features of the App:
1. Information about all the members.
2. Minutes of all the club meetings.
3. Timer, Ah Counter and Grammarian functionalities.
